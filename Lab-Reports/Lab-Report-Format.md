# Lab Report Format

## Lab Overview
The labs involve the design, assembly and test of combinational and sequential logic circuits. The logic
circuits will be designed and implemented using the Foundation Series Tools from Xilinx, Inc.\\

## Grading Policy
Grading will be based on laboratory reports and in-lab performance. TAs and/or the instructor will ask
pertinent questions to individual members of a group at random.\
The labs will be graded as follows:\
20 points – random questions\
20 points – lab report\
30 points – simulation works\
30 points – chip download works\

## Lab Instructions
• Eight lab experiments are to be conducted. Groups of 2 students will be formed. The lab report,
written individually, is due one week after the first day of the experiment at the beginning of the
next lab. Every person must submit his/her own lab report for each lab before each session.\
• You are expected to read the lab description, and complete the pre-lab before each session. Read
each week's assignment and complete any pre-lab calculations and/or design work before coming
to the lab. Try to understand the objectives of the experiment and determine what information you
should record in your laboratory notebook. If you have any questions, please see your TA before
the scheduled time of your lab.\
• Be prepared to show your pre-lab work to your TA. If you have VHDL code, schematic and
wiring diagrams ready before you come to lab, you will be able to finish quite easily during the lab
time. If you are not prepared, you may not be able to finish during the lab period and
consequently, your grade will suffer. Each lab session lasts three hours. The TA or instructor is not
required to give you extra time to complete your work.\
• Reports that appear to be copied will be returned un-graded. No late report will be accepted.\

## Lab Reports
Please use the following format for your lab reports:\
• Cover: Includes your name, student id number, course number, lab number, topic of the
experiment, section number, and names of members in your group.\
• Abstract: Brief introduction to the experiment and a summary of results.\
• Analysis: Design techniques, implementation details, e.g., K-maps, boolean equations, schematics,
etc.\
• Records: Simulation results, VHDL input and output, schematic diagrams, etc.\
• Discussion: Comments, circuit debugging and problem solving issues, and conclusions.\
