# CS120A_Logic-Design
Instructed by: Professor Kelly Downey

## Overview
EE/CS120A introduces you to the exciting world of digital design.

Digital circuits not only form the foundation of computers, but make possible many of the advances around us, like cell phones, video games, medical instruments, automotive systems, satellites, PDAs, music equipment, military equipment, store automation.

You name it -- if it runs on electricity, it's probably got digital circuits (known as embedded systems) inside!

120A gets you up to speed on the basics; the follow-up course, 120B, teaches you to build a computer, and to build complete working embedded computing systems.

EE/CS 120A and 120B are taught jointly by the EE and CS&E departments. 

## Course Description
EE/CS 120A: Logic Design (5) Lecture, 3 hours; laboratory, 6 hours.

Prerequisite(s): CS 061; Machine Organization & Assembly Language Programming

Topics include Boolean algebra; combinational and sequential logic design; design and use of arithmetic-logic units, carry-lookahead adders, multiplexors, decoders, comparators, multipliers, flip-flops, registers, and simple memories; state-machine design; and basic register-transfer level design.

Laboratories involve use of hardware description languages, synthesis tools, programmable logic, and significant hardware prototyping.
